# Aplying-Filters-on-BMP
In this repository I have uploaded my project in c which applies different filters on BMP files.

This program is not OS specific and this program will also work in Linux or any other OS.

<h4>1. To use this program you first need to create an .exe and then run file also providing command-line arguments.
<br><br>Syntax:</h4>

<p style="background-color: gray">./filter -filter pathofImage OutputImage</p>
<br><br>
<h4>You can also run the below mentioned commands on your local but for Windows instead of <p style ="background-color: rgb(10, 10, 10)">./filter use just filter</p></h4>
